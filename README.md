## About the code's solution
I Give a general solution about the evidence, i use recursions to calculate the problem's varieables and then recursion until proove that the solution is 6174

Ps 1: I left the code uncommended cause a wise old man have said to me: If it is hard to write it, it should be hard to read it too.
Ps 2: I am just kidding about Ps 1. I was bored to commend the code ;).
